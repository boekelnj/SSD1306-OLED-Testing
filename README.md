# SSD1306-OLED-Testing

This repo contains a very simple program for running some test functions on a SSD1306 OLED 128x64 display using MicroPython.  I used an ESP8266 microcontroller, but anything that supports MicroPython should work.

Here is what the test functions look like (video is sped up slightly):

You will need the SSD1306 MicroPython library, which you can get [here](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/blob/master/drivers/display/ssd1306.py).
